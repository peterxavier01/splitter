## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Context API
- React Hooks - useState, useReducer
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  user-select: none;
}
```

### Continued development

From working on this project, I have realized that I have to work on useReducer hook and thereafter, Redux. I also plan to work on some MERN stack based projects in the future.

I would like to give a shout out to Stack Overflow, of course. And also ChatGPT which has been surprisingly helpful in providing hints on how to navigate the few roadblocks met along the way.
